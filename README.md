# LBUNet with AttentionSkipFusion (ASF)

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of two models:

- **Baseline LBUNet**: A lightweight boundary-assisted UNet with multi-stage deep supervision, boundary prediction, and gated fusion mechanisms.
- **Modified LBUNet**: A streamlined architecture using AttentionSkipFusion (ASF) modules in place of handcrafted fusion blocks, with simplified supervision for faster inference.

ðŸ§ª Both models are evaluated on dermoscopic skin lesion segmentation tasks using the ISIC dataset.

## Features
- Full training and evaluation pipeline
- Modular architecture for easy experimentation
- Implements custom loss functions (BCE + Dice)
- Attention-based skip fusion module for learnable encoder-decoder integration
- Reproducible results with sample configurations

## Results Summary
The modified LBUNet achieves approximately 40% faster inference with a minor trade-off in segmentation accuracy.

## Dataset
The ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset was used for training and evaluation. Instructions for dataset preparation are provided in the README.
